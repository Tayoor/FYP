For my university Final Year Project (FYP), I collaborated with a local fuel seller to collect and analyze two years of raw data. The primary objective was to predict monthly fuel demand, specifically for diesel and petrol. I began by manually and programmatically cleaning the data using pandas. Once the data was prepared, I trained it on three different machine learning models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and ARIMA.

Among the models, the SVM model provided the best results. However, the prediction error varied between fuel types. The mean absolute error for diesel was approximately 12 units, while for petrol, it was around 30 units. The higher error rate in petrol predictions was attributed to several factors, including economic inflation and other external influences that affect petrol consumption more significantly. On the other hand, diesel predictions were more accurate, primarily because diesel sales are less sensitive to inflation, as it is mostly purchased by farmers who have consistent demand regardless of economic conditions.
